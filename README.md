# Project Euler
This repository contains my solutions, and work-in-progress solutions for the coding challenges hosted on [project euler](https://projecteuler.net).

Some of these solutions involve code snippets (such as the method isPrime) that have been found on the internet, and many of these solutions were created by working together with Adrian I.
